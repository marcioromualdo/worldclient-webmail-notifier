16/12/2010 - versão 1.1.0:

I made this addon to warn me when new mails arrive from MDaemon Mail Server. 
To test it I used the alert() javascript to see the information between Firefox and the Mail Server.
To see the javascripts alerts, in the preferences file, turn the debug variable to true.
After that, my co-workers installed the addon and they liked it very much. 
They think that is is very useful, because where we work, we cannot use the IMAP or POP3 because they are blocked by the Firewall.
At home, I installed the MDaemon Mail Server for you to test.
Use the following configuration: 
	web server: http://mdaemonmailserver.slyip.net
	user: test.user@company.mail
	password: Test123
Thank you

---EMail para WorldClient site:
Good afternoon,

I made the Mozilla Add-on "WorldClient WebMail Notifier" to warn me when new mails arrive from MDaemon Mail Server.
It checks for new mails in the MDaemon Email Server.
It is a very useful addon for users who cannot use the ComAgent or POP3 or IMAP because of the company's firewall.

The addon was fully reviewed by Mozilla Reviewers in January/2011 and has been downloaded 475 times until now.

Can you add the addon's link in your site?

The link is: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/worldclient-webmail-notifier/

Best regards,

Marcio Romualdo da Silva
